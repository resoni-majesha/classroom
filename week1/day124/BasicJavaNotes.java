	/*
	 * Java Introduction
	 * 
	 * Each topic we will learn what why etc., Golden Circle of Java
	 * Java Editors
	 * Package Class Variables
	 * Control Statements
	 * Jump Statements
	 * 
	 * What is Java - Object Oriented Programming language
	 * Why Java - Platfrom Independent, we can use the Java code in various applications
	 * Most commonly used language in real time
	 * Why Java is popular - Able to integrate with plenty of libraries like TestNG Apache POI, Extent reportsetc
	 * Selenium Webdriver is written in Java, for selenium Java is the mother language
	 * Able to easily integrate API
	 * 70% of openings are from Java with Selenium
	 * 
	 * Java Editiors - IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans - Eclipse is free, opensource - anybody can access, others are paid
	 * In companies, they will give IntelliJ, Netbeans, as they will pay
	 * 
	 * Java is OOPL, Most used by dev and automation engineer, base lang for selenium webdriver
	 * 
	 * Before coding , know Project, Package, Class, Variable & Method
	 * 
	 * Project 
	 * Starts with uppercase 
	 * Used to manage software dependencies and versions
	 * Build as execution project library
	 * If there are 100 TC's, we will store in any repository / folder - Project will contain folder 
	 * for each module in the project - Login module, payment module etc.,
	 * 
	 * Package
	 * 
	 * Package name start with lower case
	 * Package in a project is like Folder in a drive - each package for payment, mobile etc.,
	 * Helps to organize & provide security
	 * 
	 * Class Name
	 * 
	 * Starts with upper case
	 * Relevant to testcase - like positive or negative -Writing TC's in a excel sheet - Class
	 * Stores value using variables
	 * Perform some action using methods
	 * 
	 * Variables & Methods
	 * 
	 * Members of the class
	 * Variable - to store the data
	 * Method - Perform Action
	 * Method & variable start with lower case
	 * 
	 * eg: C:drive - Project, Inside C:drive, music, doc, - Package - Inside the music folder - we have movie
	 * That movie name is called as ClassName, if yu play the movie then it is called variables & methods
	 * 
	 * Create a project - File > New > Create a Project > Maven > Maven Project > Next
	 * Enter Group Id & Artifact Id - Group as (common name) Company name & Artrifact ID as company name
	 * Click on Create
	 * 
	 * Create a Java Project - Will get few folders - JRE Library & src Folder 
	 * If it is a Java Project, we need to create src main folders, libraries manually, which will consume more time
	 * 
	 * To create a package - Right click Project >New > Package > Lower case - week1.day1
	 * Here week1 will be main folder & day1 will be sub folder
	 * To view the Package, right click on project > Show In > System Explorer
	 * 
	 * To create a class, right click on package > New >> Class - Upper case
	 * 
	 * We need to write code in src/main/java - i.e. Java Package
	 * 
	 * 
	 * /*
	 * Java Architecture
	 * 
	 * Writing Java code in eclipse, how the system understand?
	 * Code written in eclipse is Java code
	 * Java will go to compiler(Intermediate - used to translate english to tamil) and will 
	 * convert the Java code into machine language(o's & 1's) .class file 
	 * Compiler is used to compile the program
	 * Then interpretor(JVM) will convert it into a machine readable language
	 * And then it will execute the code with the help of JDK
	 * JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to execute the program and gives the output                      
	 * Then it will go to JRE(Java Runtime Machine) & JVM(Java Virtual Machine) to execute the program
	 * 
	 * Components of Java Architecture
	 * 
	 * JVM, JRE + Libraries Set, JDK (JRE (JVM + Libraries Set) + Development Tools)
	 * To start with Java application, you should have Java Development kit in your system
	 * Once yu have it, u will have JRE, JVM
	 * 
	 * JRE is the implementation of JVM
	 * To run a code JRE is required
	 * In eclipse yu will see JRE will Many JAR files
	 * 
	 * JDK - contains JRE & development tools like debugger, compiler & javadoc
	 * It is a software development kit
	 * 
	 * Main method, console output
	 * 
	 * Main method entry point to execute Java program. Without main method we cannot execute Java Program
	 * public static void main(String args[])
	 * {
	 * 
	 * }
	 * Type main, ctrl+space
	 * 
	 * sysout - To print the expected value in console
	 * System.out.println("My First Program");
	 * 
	 * Todo
	 * JDK,JRE,JVM video in EdTech Platform Watch
